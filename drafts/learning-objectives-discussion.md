### Geography  

Starts with intuitive concepts  

- natural language (_a house on the lake_)      
- hardwired ([Gersmehl and Germehl (2007)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQI-PYys38wdUVG-i-PkaXf1Emt4PL9W/view?usp=sharing){target=_blank})

Then builds principles and theories that apply to many (most) disciplines   

- scale ([Montello (1993)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aPPczkXUB3QlX3lTNhwCyEngsu7_XK9B/view?usp=sharing){target=_blank})    
- social is spatial ([red-lining](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58){target=_blank})  

Map reading and making are core skills and methods   

- layers ([cadastre](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXSUi-WHo_s1XRJNevssijfcekaWNjns/view?usp=sharing){target=_blank}, [topographic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MJz7SIgN6W6_6KcR1NlSl93-ptXyM3WQ/view?usp=sharing){target=_blank})      

Asking geographic questions, brings together conceptual and procedural knowledge.
