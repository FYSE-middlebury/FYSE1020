### Writing handout  

In preparation, please start by reading [this handout](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/book-reviews/){target=_blank} from The Writing Center of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.   

### Discussion prep   

To prepare for discussions, please read the assigned chapters. For each chapter, please answer the following questions:  

- What is the thesis - or main argument - of the chapter?  
- What is the subject of the chapter?  
- How do the authors support their argument?  
- How do the authors structure their argument?  
- How has this chapter helped you understand the subject?  

In addition, please do some background research on the following:  

- Who are the authors?  
- What is the book's genre?  

Please write out your answers to these questions as a Google document. In class, I will show you how to share a link to your document so that you can share your work with peers.  

### First draft      

Please compose your review in a new Google document. This will facilitate sharing your work with peers in our workshop.  

Please again refer to the [UNC handout](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/book-reviews/){target=_blank}. Follow their four-part outline for the review:  

  1. Introduction  
  2. Summary of content  
  3. Analysis and evaluation of the book  
  4. Conclusion  

Your first draft should include a title splash with:  

  1. A title
  2. Your name  
  3. The date  
  4. The course code (FYSE 1020)  

For your first draft, you can write each part of the review as a distinct section with the names of each part as headings for each section.

### Second draft  

After workshop, you will revise the document with an eye (and ear) towards finalizing content, improving clarity, and responding to first feedback.  

### Final draft  

After a second workshop, you will work to substitute the section headers with transition sentences and look for ways to strengthen voice and polish.
