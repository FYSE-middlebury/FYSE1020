The goal for your second formal writing assignment is to connect a specific, local example to more general academic discussions about town-gown relationships.

Your task is to find a local news article (not an opinion piece or editorial) about a land use project or development off campus that involves or affects both the college and town communities. Then write a brief (<1000 word) essay that begins with this local case example and contextualizes it with a short literature review of academic research on town-gown relationships associated with this topic.  

We will discuss this prompt on Tuesday October 11. In the meantime, please use our afternoon meeting time on Thursday October 6 to begin a search for local news articles and academic research articles on a potential topic listed below.

###Potential topics  

The local case study could be either current or historical. Examples include:  

- affordable housing (Seminary Street/Summit development)  
- child care (Otter Creek child center)  
- civic development (Town Hall)  
- infrastructure development (Cross Street bridge)
- parks and open space (Trail Around Middlebury, the old Town Hall/Gym park)  
- land conservation (Breadloaf conservation easement)
- energy development (South Street Solar)
- residential development (Fields Road, Cottage Lane, Chipman Park)  

###Articles for your review  

Please select **1 news article** from either the _Addison Independent_ or _The Campus_ about a local case example. (Bonus if you compare one article from each about the same case.)   

Please select **2 - 3 academic articles** that discuss town-gown relationships illustrated by the case.

###Writing guides    

Your essay will combine news story reporting with an academic literature review.

Here are [standards for evaluating academic writing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-WSOe85Lbsz75xWFjwTdQtsj1ZnwzI4r/view?usp=sharing){target=_blank} for discussion. These were developed by my senior colleagues a number of years ago. As a junior colleague, I was expected to adopt and adapt these standards in my teaching.  

Here is [a rubric for evaluating academic writing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bgx-TdBivZveM64yEp6MJ3dkCbCN_2p8/view?usp=sharing){target=_blank} for discussion. This was developed by the former Director of the College Writing Program at Middlebury College for a review of the impact of the writing program on student writing.  

Here is [an anonymous collection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKCf5eogiUgGI8QnTwNK0EG3CE9Ssu79pL7C_RXjtCg/edit?usp=sharing){target=_blank} of titles, introductions, and conclusions from your first assignment (book review). Let's apply the rubric to each section and diagnose writing qualities.
