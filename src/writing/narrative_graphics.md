##Introduction

For this assignment, you will collaboratively write a short (1000 - 1500 word) narrative that contextualizes and extends a [natural resource inventory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCJ4sCPexdFn0Pl6MrnAFoH5eCK-VXNO/view?usp=sharing ){target=_blank} of Middlebury College Lands in the Champlain Valley. Practically, your contribution should help inform decisions and recommendations of a forthcoming management plan for Middlebury College Lands.    

This assignment aims to sharpen your skills for conducting and synthesizing previous research, writing about academic and professional knowledge for a general audience, and writing narratives to help readers interpret maps and data graphics.      

Working in a team of two to three students, you will:  

1. research a topic,  
2. develop research questions,
2. write a background section that defines key words (jargon) and summarizes that state of knowledge on your topic,
3. write a narrative that helps the reader interpret maps and data graphics (I will help you find the maps and charts to discuss).  

Ideally, your writing will help people connect specific places in Middlebury to your research topic. You will also help give voice to the needs of under-represented communities (native plants, animals, and the habitats they require) in campus planning.    


##Topics  

The table below outlines topics, guiding research questions, and seed readings. After we discuss them, you must rank your choices (first to seventh) with [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGJ32V5bmaa_p-yAkJzxVbVSTajnxjZPAIxkQCoIb6llDvWA/viewform?usp=sf_link){target=_blank}. Ideally, I will assign each topic to two or three students. Each small team will collectively write one essay about their shared topic.

##Important dates  

Please see the [calendar](../calendar.md) for the schedule. For the first two weeks, each group will meet with me for 20 minutes to discuss tasks and progress during our morning or afternoon meeting times. Weather permitting, we will visit field sites on 11/10 and 11/17. Each group will be expected to discuss information from their research that contextualizes the sites we visit. On 11/18, the first draft of the written narrative will be due (before Thanksgiving break).
