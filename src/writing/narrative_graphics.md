##Introduction

For this assignment, you will collaboratively write a short (1000 - 1500 word) narrative that explores these kinds of questions:  

1. How can college lands help people learn about the natural and human history of Middlebury?  

2. How do college lands contribute to cultural and natural values that transcend the college community?   

3. How do human values of lands differ geographically, chronologically, and thematically?  

These are starter questions that you are free to adapt and amend.  

Practically, your contribution should help inform decisions and recommendations of a forthcoming management plan for Middlebury College Lands.     

This assignment aims to sharpen your skills for conducting and synthesizing previous research, writing about academic and professional knowledge for a general audience, and writing narratives to help readers interpret maps and data graphics.      

Working in a team of two to three students, you will:  

1. research a topic,  
2. develop a set of educational questions and learning objectives,
2. write a background section that defines key words (jargon) and summarizes that state of knowledge on your topic,
3. write a narrative that helps the reader interpret maps and data graphics (I will help you find the maps and charts to discuss).  

Ideally, your writing will help people connect specific places in Middlebury to your research topic. You will also help give voice to the needs of under-represented communities (native plants, animals, and the habitats they require) in campus planning.    

##Topics  

The table below outlines topics, guiding research questions, and seed readings. After we discuss them, you must rank your choices (first to seventh) with [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGJ32V5bmaa_p-yAkJzxVbVSTajnxjZPAIxkQCoIb6llDvWA/viewform?usp=sf_link){target=_blank}. Ideally, I will assign each topic to two or three students. Each small team will collectively write one essay about their shared topic.

##Important dates  

Please see the [calendar](../calendar.md) for the schedule. For the first two weeks, each group will meet with me for 20 minutes to discuss tasks and progress during our morning or afternoon meeting times. Weather permitting, we will visit field sites on 11/10 and 11/17. Each group will be expected to discuss information from their research that contextualizes the sites we visit. On 11/18, the first draft of the written narrative will be due (before Thanksgiving break).     

##Discussion 11/01  

Reading: [Lapin-et-al (2015)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCJ4sCPexdFn0Pl6MrnAFoH5eCK-VXNO/view){target=_blank}

Questions  

- Do you think 'land values' are inherently subjective and/or political?  
- Is it possible to define 'land values' in ways that minimize subjectivity?   

- How do the authors situate college lands in a larger geographical context?  
- How do the authors situate college lands in a larger historical context?  

- How did the authors address or represent your topic?  

Towards a resource for learning place

##Discussion 11/08  

The goal today is to explore comparative frameworks for analysis of your college land topic.  

- _Geographic_: compare and contrast town and college.
- _Chronological_: compare and contrast one topic over time.  
- _Thematic_: compare and contrast two or more topics (_we will do this collectively when we develop the symposium presentation_).     

My intention here is not to overwhelm you, but rather to encourage strategies for mining information quickly from multiple sources as source material for interesting writing.  

###Town Plan  

Please create a new header in your document that is shared with me in the _resources_ drive named: 'Town Plan'.   

Please search the [Middlebury Town Plan](https://cms5.revize.com/revize/middlebury/document_center/Planning%20Zoning/Middlebury-2017-Town-Plan.pdf){target=_blank} for key words associated with your topic and answer these questions:  

- Is your topic represented in the Town Plan? (Please keep track of important pages.)  
- How does the Town Plan frame values of your topic?  
- What specific places in Middlebury does the Town Plan associate with these values?  
- Where do these values overlap college lands?  


###College Plans  

Please create a new header in your document named: 'College Plans'.  

Then please search these College resources for key words associated with your topic:  

- [Ecological Stewardship of College Lands](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v87djmVVbuYavgJqc4smtb_PXmcmeIHi/view?usp=share_link){target=_blank}  
- [Middlebury College Master Plan 2008](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oiv7XVlOQetrJLfz6IFFqlFV1EigegVV/view?usp=sharing){target=_blank}  
- [Middlebury College Master Plan Update 2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XL26rIn97uuNj6BjDNmK3hybBFR6Xez2/view?usp=share_link){target=_blank}

- [Middlebury College Land Acknowledgement](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/about/middlebury-land-acknowledgment){target=_blank}  


Then please write answers to these questions in your document:  

- Is your topic represented in these documents? (Please keep track of source and important pages.)  
- How do these documents frame values of your topic?  
- How do the values and discussion of your topic differ between College and Town documents (compare/contrast)?    
- What specific places on college lands do these documents associate with these values?  
- Can you compare and contrast the discussion of your topic over time?    

Please use the class time today to get started on this. We will discuss briefly at the end of today's session and then share findings in class on 11/15.
