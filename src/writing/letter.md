## Letter to your future self  

<mark>_Due 9/13 </mark> at beginning of class_

### Assignment  

Please write a 1-3 page, handwritten letter to your future self. I ask that you handwrite the letter so that you will not be able to read it again until your graduation week four or more years from now.  

Please bring the letter to our class meeting on Tuesday, September 13. At the beginning of class, I will provide you an envelope, you will address the envelope to your future self, you will seal the contents, and I will hold the sealed letter in a secure place in my office until the week that you graduate, when I will return it to you.   

Please know that I will never read the letter that your write. Nor will your peers. The letter is just for you to read, four or more years from now, when you begin to look back and reflect on your time at Middlebury.      

### Instructions  

Please find a place on campus or in town to write. Ideally, this will be someplace that you can return to in the future when you are about to graduate and perhaps again many years later when you return to Middlebury for reunions as an alumnus.  

Start the letter by describing the scene you are in:  

- where are you?  
- what's the weather like?  
- what do you see around you?  
- what looks familiar?
- what looks different from what you are used to?   

Then describe how you are feeling:  

- how does the scene around you make your feel?  
- what is your mood like today?  
- what are you excited about?  
- what are you nervous about?  

Then try to re-introduce your present self to your future self:  

- is your mood today usual for you or does it feel new?
- what are the most important things to you right now?
- what do you like about yourself?
- what do you hope to change about yourself?   

Tell your future self what you hope you will do in the next four years:  

- what are your goals for college?
- what kinds of things do you hope to learn?
- what kinds of experiences do you hope to have?  

Tell your future self how you think your time at Middlebury should be evaluated when you are done:  

- how will you know that you made good decisions here?  
- how will you know that you learned from mistakes or rough patches along the way?  
- what adjectives do you hope describe you four years from now?    

And then sign off and wish yourself well, now and in the future.
