##Multimedia principles    

_11/29 discussion_

Discuss today's reading: [Research-Based Principles for Designing Multimedia Instruction](http://hilt.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HILT_SpeakerSeries_Mayer_background_reading.pdf){target=_blank}  

- What is the thesis of this research article?   
- How does the author present key terms?  
- How is the written narrative related to the graphics in the article?
- What are three _core assumptions_ of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML)?  
- What are the key _memory stores_ in CTML?  
- What are the key _cognitive processes_ in CTML?  
- What are the three kinds of _cognitive processing_ that can occur during multimedia instruction?  
- Define and explain the five principles for _reducing extraneous processing_.  
- Define and explain the three principles for _managing essential processing_.  
- Define and explain the four principles for _fostering generative processing_.
- How does the author illustrate the application of these principles for a presentation on how a solar cell works?  

Many of Mayer's examples deal with presentations that try to help the audience understand _how something works_.  

- What parts of your narrative are similar to this goal?  
- What parts are different?  

For **Thursday**, please brainstorm how to storyboard your narrative:  

- What picture or graphic can you show to complement each key point in your verbal narrative?  
- How does the visual presentation of your essay affect the structure and content of your written narrative?  
- What multimedia principles apply to your choice of pictures?

###Constraints  

Here are some facts about the symposium and our session. I think of these as design constraints - they define the environment that you will be presenting in, the audience that you can expect, and the amount of time that you have to get your ideas across.      

- The symposium is scheduled for Friday December 9.   

- There are 20 seminars scheduled to present during the symposium (there were 44 FY seminars offered this semester)

- Our session begins at 6:30pm.

- Our session is in Axinn 220.

- There are two other seminars that will be presenting in our session:

    - Professor Magri: 'How money makes the world go round'  

    - Professor Porteous: 'Growth and its limits'  

- For our seminar, each group will have 5 minutes to present.  

###Platform  

Please use [Google Slides](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282488?hl=en){target=_blank} for your slide presentations. It facilitates collaboration and helps make your materials available to your audience after your presentation.    

###Rules of thumb  

Here are some general rules of thumb for creating a slide presentation:  

- Put the title and authors on the first slide and the credits and links on the last slide.  

    - The last slide should include an accessible link to your presentation (for example, a QR code) and a hyperlink to your paper.

- Try to avoid putting full sentences on a slide, especially if you intend to read the full sentence orally.    

    - Of course, there are exceptions to this. For example, you certainly can write out an important quote from a book or author.  

    - The main idea is to not think of the text on a slide as the equivalent of your narrative text that you then read verbatim to the audience.  

- Do not show any content slide for more than 20 seconds before moving on to the next slide.

    - For a five minute presentation, this means you need a _minimum_ of 15 content slides (not including the first and last slide). If you segment your presentation well, you may need twice this number.   

- Do not present more than three ideas on any individual slide.  

    - Less is more. An audience can only process so much information in 20 seconds. So aim for bite-sized chunks of information.  

    - Break a dense slide into a sequence of slides that segment an idea into smaller chunks.  

- For each content slide, the title or header should convey the essence of the slide's key point.  

    - Signal (prime the audience's attention) to the purpose of the slide before leading them through the details of the slide.  

- Put reference information on the slides so that they are there if people want them without being distracting.  

    - Put author-date formatted citations in the lower right corner of the slide and use a color with low contrast to your background.  

##Circular narratives  

- Consider a beginning that you can return to at the end where the audience can sense a change in their understanding.  

    - For example, ask a concrete question at the beginning that the audience may not know how to answer, then return to it at the end, when hopefully the audience may now be better prepared to answer it.  

##Select and lure   

- Your presentation should not try to deliver all of the content in your paper.  

- The purpose of your presentation is to entice the audience to read your paper because you made them want to know more about your subject.  

- Focus on presenting the most interesting parts of your paper that still tells a coherent story even when isolated from the longer narrative.
