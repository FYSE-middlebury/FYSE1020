Your first image interpretation task is to map when buildings were developed on college lands by inspecting a series of air photographs taken in 1942, early-1990s, 2006, 2016, and in the past year.    

To help you do this, you will use the following materials:  

1. [this web app](https://jhowarth.users.earthengine.app/view/midd-change-1942-2022){target=_blank} that I built for you,
2. [this map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14M6ZbD1bUfJq8dykvX7Zsng5UYI_EZcj/view?usp=sharing){target=_blank} that I made for you,
3. and [this pen](https://content.etilize.com/2000/11960987.jpg){target=_blank} that I bought for you.  

In class, we will talk through how to use the app, map, and pen to complete the task.    

When coloring your map with your pen, please remember to follow these map key rules:  

| Color                                       | When building appears                 |
| :---                                        | :---                                  |
