The task tags link to fuller descriptions. Please note that the two types of tasks are somewhat arbitrary, as any _writing_ task will of course require some reading and each _reading_ task will require some writing (a short synthesis, a set of questions, etc). The main difference between the two is that _writing_ tasks will involve some intentional discussion on writing as a purposeful object, while in _reading_ tasks the writing is simply a means to thinking or discussing the material.     

_Please note: I will add links for tasks to this calendar as the semester progresses._
