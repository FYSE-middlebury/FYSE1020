We will study the natural and human histories of land and investigate relationships between Middlebury College and local human and natural communities. We ground these themes at field sites along a transect from the Champlain Valley to the Green Mountains where college and non-college communities overlap in space and time. Students explore questions from multi-disciplinary perspectives, learn to interpret and integrate different kinds of evidence, including texts, images, maps, and direct observations, share their work with peers to help contextualize field excursions, and produce a short presentation for the First Year Symposium. The course is organized in three parts. The first part focuses on the development of the campus as something both insulated and connected to the town. The second part focuses on the development of college-owned lands with respect to the longer natural and human history of Middlebury. We then evaluate the potential contribution of college lands for a plan to conserve the biological and rural heritage of the Town of Middlebury. The third part will focus on the development of a multimedia presentation on our findings for the First Year Symposium. For the first two parts of the course, you will complete three short (< 750 - 1000 words) writing assignments that aim to introduce you to different types of college writing, including interpretations of images, maps, graphics, and scholarly books and planning documents. The third part of the course will focus on developing a multimedia presentation (pairing words and pictures) with your peers that shares our findings from the course with the public.","title":"Description"},{"location":"evaluation/","text":"The table below describes the four components of your grade and their weights.

I ask that you handwrite the letter so that you will not be able to read it again until your graduation week four or more years from now. Please bring the letter to our class meeting on Tuesday, September 13. At the beginning of class, I will provide you an envelope, you will address the envelope to your future self, you will seal the contents, and I will hold the sealed letter in a secure place in my office until the week that you graduate, when I will return it to you. Please know that I will never read the letter that your write. Nor will your peers. The letter is just for you to read, four or more years from now, when you begin to look back and reflect on your time at Middlebury. Instructions Please find a place on campus or in town to write. Ideally, this will be someplace that you can return to in the future when you are about to graduate and perhaps again many years later when you return to Middlebury for reunions as an alumnus. Start the letter by describing the scene you are in: where are you? what\u2019s the weather like? what do you see around you? what looks familiar? what looks different from what you are used to? Then describe how you are feeling: how does the scene around you make your feel? what is your mood like today? what are you excited about? what are you nervous about? Then try to re-introduce your present self to your future self: is your mood today usual for you or does it feel new? what are the most important things to you right now? what do you like about yourself? what do you hope to change about yourself? Tell your future self what you hope you will do in the next four years: what are your goals for college? what kinds of things do you hope to learn? what kinds of experiences do you hope to have? Tell your future self how you think your time at Middlebury should be evaluated when you are done: how will you know that you made good decisions here? how will you know that you learned from mistakes or rough patches along the way? what adjectives do you hope describe you four years from now?

Your task is to find a local news article (not an opinion piece or editorial) about a land use project or development off campus that involves or affects both the college and town communities. Then write a brief (<1000 word) essay that begins with this local case example and contextualizes it with a short literature review of academic research on town-gown relationships associated with this topic. We will discuss this prompt on Tuesday October 11. In the meantime, please use our afternoon meeting time on Thursday October 6 to begin a search for local news articles and academic research articles on a potential topic listed below. Potential topics The local case study could be either current or historical. Examples include: affordable housing (Seminary Street/Summit development) child care (Otter Creek child center) civic development (Town Hall) infrastructure development (Cross Street bridge) parks and open space (Trail Around Middlebury, the old Town Hall/Gym park) land conservation (Breadloaf conservation easement) energy development (South Street Solar) residential development (Fields Road, Cottage Lane, Chipman Park) Articles for your review Please select 1 news article from either the Addison Independent or The Campus about a local case example. (Bonus if you compare one article from each about the same case.) Please select 2 - 3 academic articles that discuss town-gown relationships illustrated by the case. Writing guides Your essay will combine news story reporting with an academic literature review. For guidance on writing a news story, please read this resource from Northwestern University. For guidance on writing a literature review, please read this resource from The Writing Center at UNC Chapel Hill. On Tuesday October 11 we will discuss how to adapt these guides for this assignment.

Writing workshop 10/18 Here are standards for evaluating academic writing for discussion. These were developed by my senior colleagues a number of years ago. As a junior colleague, I was expected to adopt and adapt these standards in my teaching. Here is a rubric for evaluating academic writing for discussion. This was developed by the former Director of the College Writing Program at Middlebury College for a review of the impact of the writing program on student writing. Here is an anonymous collection of titles, introductions, and conclusions from your first assignment (book review). Let\u2019s apply the rubric to each section and diagnose writing qualities.","title":"Literature review"},{"location":"writing/narrative_graphics/","text":"For this assignment, you will collaboratively write a short (1000 - 1500 word) narrative that contextualizes and extends a natural resource inventory of Middlebury College Lands in the Champlain Valley. Practically, your contribution should help inform decisions and recommendations of a forthcoming management plan for Middlebury College Lands. This assignment aims to sharpen your skills for conducting and synthesizing previous research, writing about academic and professional knowledge for a general audience, and writing narratives to help readers interpret maps and data graphics. Working in a team of two to three students, you will: research a topic, develop research questions, write a background section that defines key words (jargon) and summarizes that state of knowledge on your topic, write a narrative that helps the reader interpret maps and data graphics (I will help you find the maps and charts to discuss). Ideally, your writing will help people connect specific places in Middlebury to your research topic. You will also help give voice to the needs of under-represented communities (native plants, animals, and the habitats they require) in campus planning. Topics The table below outlines topics, guiding research questions, and seed readings. After we discuss them, you must rank your choices (first to seventh) with this form . Ideally, I will assign each topic to two or three students. Each small team will collectively write one essay about their shared topic.
