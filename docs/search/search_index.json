Please note that the two types of tasks are somewhat arbitrary, as any writing task will of course require some reading and each reading task will require some writing (a short synthesis, a set of questions, etc). The main difference between the two is that writing tasks will involve some intentional discussion on writing as a purposeful object, while in reading tasks the writing is simply a means to thinking or discussing the material. Please note: I will add links for tasks to this calendar as the semester progresses.

We will study the natural and human histories of land and investigate relationships between Middlebury College and local human and natural communities. We ground these themes at field sites along a transect from the Champlain Valley to the Green Mountains where college and non-college communities overlap in space and time. Students explore questions from multi-disciplinary perspectives, learn to interpret and integrate different kinds of evidence, including texts, images, maps, and direct observations, share their work with peers to help contextualize field excursions, and produce a short presentation for the First Year Symposium. The course is organized in three parts. The first part focuses on the development of the campus as something both insulated and connected to the town. The second part focuses on the development of college-owned lands with respect to the longer natural and human history of Middlebury and evaluate the potential contribution of college lands for a plan to conserve the biological and rural heritage of the Town of Middlebury. The third part will focus on the development of a multimedia presentation on our findings for the First Year Symposium. For the first two parts of the course, you will complete three short (< 500-1000 words) writing assignments that aim to introduce you to different types of college writing, including interpretations of images, maps, graphics, and scholarly books and articles. The third part of the course will focus on developing a multimedia presentation (pairing words and pictures) with your peers that shares our findings from the course with the public.","title":"Description"},{"location":"evaluation/","text":"The table below describes the four components of your grade and their weights.

I ask that you handwrite the letter so that you will not be able to read it again until your graduation week four or more years from now. Please bring the letter to our class meeting on Tuesday, September 13. At the beginning of class, I will provide you an envelope, you will address the envelope to your future self, you will seal the contents, and I will hold the sealed letter in a secure place in my office until the week that you graduate, when I will return it to you. Please know that I will never read the letter that your write. Nor will your peers. The letter is just for you to read, four or more years from now, when you begin to look back and reflect on your time at Middlebury. Instructions Please find a place on campus or in town to write. Ideally, this will be someplace that you can return to in the future when you are about to graduate and perhaps again many years later when you return to Middlebury for reunions as an alumnus. Start the letter by describing the scene you are in: where are you? what\u2019s the weather like? what do you see around you? what looks familiar? what looks different from what you are used to? Then describe how you are feeling: how does the scene around you make your feel? what is your mood like today? what are you excited about? what are you nervous about? Then try to re-introduce your present self to your future self: is your mood today usual for you or does it feel new? what are the most important things to you right now? what do you like about yourself? what do you hope to change about yourself? Tell your future self what you hope you will do in the next four years: what are your goals for college? what kinds of things do you hope to learn? what kinds of experiences do you hope to have? Tell your future self how you think your time at Middlebury should be evaluated when you are done: how will you know that you made good decisions here? how will you know that you learned from mistakes or rough patches along the way? what adjectives do you hope describe you four years from now? And then sign off and wish yourself well, now and in the future.","title":"0913"},{"location":"tasks/0915/","text":"Map reading Map interpretation exercise.
